# wardrobe

(I named it **wardrobe** because it's an in-house Redis replica I built. What better name for in-house storage than **wardrobe** )

**wardrobe** is a fast, minimalist in-memory key-value store written in Go, inspired by Redis. Built from scratch, it supports core Redis functionalities like persistence, replication, transactions, streams, and TTL — all accessible via `redis-cli`.

---

## features

- **In-Memory Storage** – blazing fast access
- **RDB Persistence** – saves data to `dump.rdb`
- **Master-Slave Replication** – supports replication config
- **TTL Support** – with `EXPIRE` and time-based key eviction
- **Transactions** – with `MULTI` and `EXEC`
- **Streams** – with `XADD`
- Fully **redis-cli compatible**

## how do you run this ?

### 1. clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siddarthpai/wardrobe.git
cd wardrobe
go build -o wardrobe

```

### 2. run the server

```bash
./wardrobe --port 8000

```

---

## using `redis-cli` to test

```bash
redis-cli -p 8000
```

---

## testing out persistence

- `dump.rdb` is auto-loaded on startup if available.

---

## future enhancements

- supporting more data types, rn supports strings, lists and sets.
- snapshotting of rdb and AOF.
- look into making it more of a valkey replica with multithreading.
